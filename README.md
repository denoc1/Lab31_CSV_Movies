You have the code for reading in the movie data.

1.  Write a method filterByYear() that prints all movies released after a given year (passed as a parameter)


         public static void filterByYear(ArrayList<Movie> movies, int year)


3.  Write a method getAverageRating() that prints the average rating of all the movies in the list.


          public static double getAverageRating(ArrayList<Movie> movies)


5.  List how many movies of a particular genre (e.g. “Comedy”) countByGenre()  Be careful - remember, there are some movies that have multiple genres.  How will you do this?


           public static void countByGenre(ArrayList<Movie> movies, String genre)
